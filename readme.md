### OBJECTIVE 📰: 

* I hope this repository will help any of my colleagues, future juniors @SLIIT or even anyone to understand the fundamentals of C.


### Note 📝

* Please do note I'm not a C expert (currently just an Y1:S1 undergrad). So, if you found out that I have made a mistake anywhere on my code please feel free to create a new issue or contribute via a pull request 🙂.

* Your contributions with new exercises are appreciated 🤝.

### DISCLAIMER ⚠️
> Please do note that the code for all exercises is designed with the intention of helping the students to understand the question and to get the idea/concept of how the code (solution) works. Please note that plagiarising the content from this repository on your tests might/will get you in trouble and the creators of this repository will not be responsible. So, please stick with your own ways of coding the solution for a given problem (on your tests).

> Thanks 🙂.
